# Low Level System Design - Log Framework

### Problem Statement
Design a comprehensive and extensible logging framework that supports multiple log levels & destinations.

- Support multiple log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) with configurable filtering.
- Enable logging to multiple destinations simultaneously (Console, File, Remote).
- Support configurable log formatting and timestamping.
- Design with extensibility in mind for adding new log levels and destinations.
